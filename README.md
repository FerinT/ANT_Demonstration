# Ant Ivy and jUnit

This project demonstrates how to use ant, ivy and junit alongside one another.

The project is built using Ant, there after I call an ivy file to retrieve dependencies from the artifactory. The ant file also compiles and runs a jUnit test.

In order to run this file you would need to clone it. In terminal go to the directory to which you cloned the project and run the "ant" command.
